# This is Slidewriter.io
Create presentations as fast as you write.

## Problem
1. Presentations are too hard to make.  
2. They're fussy to arrange, there are **too many _options_**.
3. They encourage _more_ (more text, more imagery, just...more).

### And that takes away from your message.

## The power of plain text.
* Write your presentations in a simple format that lets you make changes easily. 
* Use [Markdown](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/collaborate/markdown-guidance) to add headings, formatted text, lists, and more.

## Lists? Not a problem.
1. Numbered lists
 * Or bulleted 
    * Or nested lists
3. No big deal.

## Easy images 
* Copy and paste in an image URL to include an image. 
  * Instagram URLs are turned into images. 
  * Dropbox picture links, too.
* Images resize automatically

## Videos, too
Paste in a YouTube or Vimeo URL to get it automatically embedded.

## We :heart: emoji! :thumbsup:
Use Slack-style emoji shortcodes to include emoji easily.
For example, type `:`heart`:` or `:`thumbsup`:` to get the above.

## Simple Charts
Add basic line, bar, area, pie, and doughnut charts to your presentation with a single, readable line. Tweak axis settings, colors, and more. 
[barchart with min 0, max 100, legend off, step 25, data "Q1" 75, "Q2" 25, "Q3" 57]

## Themes
This deck is using the _Basic_ theme.  Click the **Design** button on the left and try changing the theme to something different, such as _Cool Logic Dark_.

## Code Formatting = true;
Choose a separate theme for code blocks. This deck uses _Atom One_. There's more in the Design panel.
```
function hello(str) {
   return `Hello, ${str}.`; 
}
```

## Personalize your presentation
* Choose your theme
* Change fonts and text size
* Change colors
* Add a footer or watermark

## Consistency that helps you communicate
Design tweaks you make affect all slides, so you get a consistent, professional look to your deck with almost no effort.

## We're working!
More fonts, themes, integration with other services, and more are constantly being added!
