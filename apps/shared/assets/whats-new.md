## Create a slide footer or watermark

Sometimes something is worth saying on every slide, and now you
can. Create a slide footer that shows your online handle, your
organization's name, or maybe a reminder message, such as, 
"CONFIDENTIAL." Serious stuff, and now you have serious support 
for it. Click the Footer sidebar item to customize your 
presentation's footer. Add text, change the background color, or 
fade it to create a subtle watermark effect. 

## New fonts and themes

It's been a while since we've touched themes and fonts, and while
you can customize any presentation, sometimes you just want someone
to do the work for you. We get it. That's why we added two new themes, 
Cool Logic and Cool Logic (Dark). Featuring some of our new fonts, we 
think they manage to pull off "professional" and "snazzy" at the same
time. Try it out from the newly renamed Appearance sidebar item.

## A little more responsive

We're taking a tiny step toward making the site more responsive to 
narrow screen sizes with a new veritical layout when the browser 
window is narrow enough. This makes better use of your space, giving 
you enough room to write and preview your slides comfortably.

## Bug Fixes

* We fixed an issue with a twitchy input box in the Playback options, and
took the opportunity to add some better validation messages for it, too.
* When using an "auto advance" playback option, we no longer auto advance
once the presentation has reached the end. That way, you can go back and
forth in the presentation during a Q+A session without it continuing to
advance to the next slide.

## Support for Gists

We like what we've got going so far on Slidewriter.io, but can't help
but feel like we're missing something. Something like support for 
saving and loading presentations, instead of just locking you into 
always working on a single presentation. We also want to make it 
easier to share presentations, too.

And we're working on that, but in the meantime, if you have a Github
account, you can [use gists to share your presentation on Slidewriter.io](/gist).
Export your presentation and keep it as a gist and you can share it
out.  

## Export

You can now export your presentation to a .md Markdown file. It's
not as nice as simply saving, but it's one step closer, and it helps
when it comes to using gists to share a presentation. The exported
presentation contains your slide content as well as metadata, such
as theme and any customizations you've applied.

## Fixed! Emoji in Windows

We're sorry, Windows people. Our emoji library didn't work as we 
expected, and our emoji support was effectively broken in Windows.
It's all better now. 

## Page up, page down

We added Page Up and Page Down to the list of keys you with which you
can use to navigate through a presentation. This lets the site
work with a broader range of clickers.

## No more cursor in presentations

We've taken extra steps to hide the pointer when viewing a
presentation in full-screen mode.

## New keyboard shortcuts and help buttons

When you close this panel, look in the lower right and you'll see
two new buttons, one for showing the keyboard shortcuts, and one
for help. They also load in this same side panel, which we think 
is pretty sharp, too.

## Updated Help docs

Speaking of help, our help docs haven't been keeping up with the 
site lately, so we've shown them some love.

## What's new is new

We're getting a little meta now, but we have to mention that this
What's New panel is new. Check here for changes as they happen!
